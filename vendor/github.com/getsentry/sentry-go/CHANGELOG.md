# Changelog

## 0.21.0

The Sentry SDK team is happy to announce the immediate availability of Sentry Go SDK v0.21.0.

Note: this release includes one **breaking change** and some **deprecations**, which are listed below.

### Breaking Changes

**This change does not apply if you use [https://sentry.io](https://sentry.io)**

- Remove support for the `/store` endpoint ([#631](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/631))
  - This change requires a self-hosted version of Sentry 20.6.0 or higher. If you are using a version of [self-hosted Sentry](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/) (aka *on-premise*) older than 20.6.0, then you will need to [upgrade](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/releases/) your instance.

### Features

- Rename four span option functions ([#611](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/611), [#624](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/624))
  - `TransctionSource` -> `WithTransactionSource`
  - `SpanSampled` -> `WithSpanSampled`
  - `OpName` -> `WithOpName`
  - `TransactionName` -> `WithTransactionName`
  - Old functions `TransctionSource`, `SpanSampled`, `OpName`, and `TransactionName` are still available but are now **deprecated** and will be removed in a future release.
- Make `client.EventFromMessage` and `client.EventFromException` methods public ([#607](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/607))
- Add `client.SetException` method ([#607](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/607))
  - This allows to set or add errors to an existing `Event`.

### Bug Fixes

- Protect from panics while doing concurrent reads/writes to Span data fields ([#609](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/609))
- [otel] Improve detection of Sentry-related spans ([#632](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/632), [#636](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/636))
  - Fixes cases when HTTP spans containing requests to Sentry were captured by Sentry ([#627](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/issues/627))

### Misc

- Drop testing in (legacy) GOPATH mode ([#618](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/618))
- Remove outdated documentation from https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/getsentry/sentry-go ([#623](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/623))

## 0.20.0

The Sentry SDK team is happy to announce the immediate availability of Sentry Go SDK v0.20.0.

Note: this release has some **breaking changes**, which are listed below.

### Breaking Changes

- Remove the following methods: `Scope.SetTransaction()`, `Scope.Transaction()` ([#605](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/605))

  Span.Name should be used instead to access the transaction's name.

  For example, the following [`TracesSampler`](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/go/configuration/sampling/#setting-a-sampling-function) function should be now written as follows:

  **Before:**
  ```go
  TracesSampler: func(ctx sentry.SamplingContext) float64 {
    hub := sentry.GetHubFromContext(ctx.Span.Context())
    if hub.Scope().Transaction() == "GET /health" {
      return 0
    }
    return 1
  },
  ```

  **After:**
  ```go
  TracesSampler: func(ctx sentry.SamplingContext) float64 {
    if ctx.Span.Name == "GET /health" {
      return 0
    }
    return 1
  },
  ```

### Features

- Add `Span.SetContext()` method ([#599](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/599/))
  - It is recommended to use it instead of `hub.Scope().SetContext` when setting or updating context on transactions.
- Add `DebugMeta` interface to `Event` and extend `Frame` structure with more fields ([#606](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/606))
  - More about DebugMeta interface [here](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/debugmeta/).

### Bug Fixes

- [otel] Fix missing OpenTelemetry context on some events ([#599](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/599), [#605](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/605))
  - Fixes ([#596](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/issues/596)).
- [otel] Better handling for HTTP span attributes ([#610](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/610))

### Misc

- Bump minimum versions: `github.com/kataras/iris/v12` to 12.2.0, `github.com/labstack/echo/v4` to v4.10.0 ([#595](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/595))
  - Resolves [GO-2022-1144 / CVE-2022-41717](https://deps.dev/advisory/osv/GO-2022-1144), [GO-2023-1495 / CVE-2022-41721](https://deps.dev/advisory/osv/GO-2023-1495), [GO-2022-1059 / CVE-2022-32149](https://deps.dev/advisory/osv/GO-2022-1059).
- Bump `google.golang.org/protobuf` minimum required version to 1.29.1  ([#604](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/604))
  - This fixes a potential denial of service issue ([CVE-2023-24535](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hw7c-3rfg-p46j)).
- Exclude the `otel` module when building in GOPATH mode ([#615](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/615))

## 0.19.0

The Sentry SDK team is happy to announce the immediate availability of Sentry Go SDK v0.19.0.

### Features

- Add support for exception mechanism metadata ([#564](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/564/))
  - More about exception mechanisms [here](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/exception/#exception-mechanism).

### Bug Fixes
- [otel] Use the correct "trace" context when sending a Sentry error ([#580](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/580/))


### Misc
- Drop support for Go 1.17, add support for Go 1.20 ([#563](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/563/))
  - According to our policy, we're officially supporting the last three minor releases of Go.
- Switch repository license to MIT ([#583](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/583/))
  - More about Sentry licensing [here](https://open.sentry.io/licensing/).
- Bump `golang.org/x/text` minimum required version to 0.3.8 ([#586](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/586))
  - This fixes [CVE-2022-32149](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-69ch-w2m2-3vjp) vulnerability.

## 0.18.0

The Sentry SDK team is happy to announce the immediate availability of Sentry Go SDK v0.18.0.
This release contains initial support for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and various other bug fixes and improvements.

**Note**: This is the last release supporting Go 1.17.

### Features

- Initial support for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).
  You can now send all your OpenTelemetry spans to Sentry.

  Install the `otel` module

  ```bash
  go get github.com/getsentry/sentry-go \
         github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/otel
  ```

  Configure the Sentry and OpenTelemetry SDKs

  ```go
  import (
      "go.opentelemetry.io/otel"
      sdktrace "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace"
      "github.com/getsentry/sentry-go"
      "github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/otel"
      // ...
  )

  // Initlaize the Sentry SDK
  sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
      Dsn:              "__DSN__",
      EnableTracing:    true,
      TracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  })

  // Set up the Sentry span processor
  tp := sdktrace.NewTracerProvider(
      sdktrace.WithSpanProcessor(sentryotel.NewSentrySpanProcessor()),
      // ...
  )
  otel.SetTracerProvider(tp)

  // Set up the Sentry propagator
  otel.SetTextMapPropagator(sentryotel.NewSentryPropagator())
  ```

  You can read more about using OpenTelemetry with Sentry in our [docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/go/performance/instrumentation/opentelemetry/).

### Bug Fixes

- Do not freeze the Dynamic Sampling Context when no Sentry values are present in the baggage header ([#532](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/532))
- Create a frozen Dynamic Sampling Context when calling `span.ToBaggage()` ([#566](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/566))
- Fix baggage parsing and encoding in vendored otel package ([#568](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/568))

### Misc

- Add `Span.SetDynamicSamplingContext()` ([#539](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/539/))
- Add various getters for `Dsn` ([#540](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/540))
- Add `SpanOption::SpanSampled` ([#546](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/546))
- Add `Span.SetData()` ([#542](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/542))
- Add `Span.IsTransaction()` ([#543](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/543))
- Add `Span.GetTransaction()` method ([#558](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/558))

## 0.17.0

The Sentry SDK team is happy to announce the immediate availability of Sentry Go SDK v0.17.0.
This release contains a new `BeforeSendTransaction` hook option and corrects two regressions introduced in `0.16.0`.

### Features

- Add `BeforeSendTransaction` hook to `ClientOptions` ([#517](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/517))
  - Here's [an example](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/blob/master/_examples/http/main.go#L56-L66) of how BeforeSendTransaction can be used to modify or drop transaction events.

### Bug Fixes

- Do not crash in Span.Finish() when the Client is empty [#520](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/520)
  - Fixes [#518](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/issues/518)
- Attach non-PII/non-sensitive request headers to events when `ClientOptions.SendDefaultPii` is set to `false` ([#524](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/524))
  - Fixes [#523](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/issues/523)

### Misc

- Clarify how to handle logrus.Fatalf events ([#501](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/501/))
- Rename the `examples` directory to `_examples` ([#521](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/521))
  - This removes an indirect dependency to `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt`

## 0.16.0

The Sentry SDK team is happy to announce the immediate availability of Sentry Go SDK v0.16.0.
Due to ongoing work towards a stable API for `v1.0.0`, we sadly had to include **two breaking changes** in this release.

### Breaking Changes

- Add `EnableTracing`, a boolean option flag to enable performance monitoring (`false` by default).
   - If you're using `TracesSampleRate` or `TracesSampler`, this option is **required** to enable performance monitoring.

      ```go
      sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
          EnableTracing: true,
          TracesSampleRate: 1.0,
      })
      ```
- Unify TracesSampler [#498](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/498)
    - `TracesSampler` was changed to a callback that must return a `float64` between `0.0` and `1.0`.

       For example, you can apply a sample rate of `1.0` (100%) to all `/api` transactions, and a sample rate of `0.5` (50%) to all other transactions.
       You can read more about this in our [SDK docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/go/configuration/filtering/#using-sampling-to-filter-transaction-events).

       ```go
       sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
           TracesSampler: sentry.TracesSampler(func(ctx sentry.SamplingContext) float64 {
                hub := sentry.GetHubFromContext(ctx.Span.Context())
                name := hub.Scope().Transaction()

                if strings.HasPrefix(name, "GET /api") {
                    return 1.0
                }

                return 0.5
            }),
        }
        ```

### Features

- Send errors logged with [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) to Sentry.
    - Have a look at our [logrus examples](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/blob/master/_examples/logrus/main.go) on how to use the integration.
- Add support for Dynamic Sampling [#491](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/491)
    - You can read more about Dynamic Sampling in our [product docs](https://docs.sentry.io/product/data-management-settings/dynamic-sampling/).
- Add detailed logging about the reason transactions are being dropped.
    - You can enable SDK logging via `sentry.ClientOptions.Debug: true`.

### Bug Fixes

- Do not clone the hub when calling `StartTransaction` [#505](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/505)
    - Fixes [#502](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/issues/502)

## 0.15.0

- fix: Scope values should not override Event values (#446)
- feat: Make maximum amount of spans configurable (#460)
- feat: Add a method to start a transaction (#482)
- feat: Extend User interface by adding Data, Name and Segment (#483)
- feat: Add ClientOptions.SendDefaultPII (#485)

## 0.14.0

- feat: Add function to continue from trace string (#434)
- feat: Add `max-depth` options (#428)
- *[breaking]* ref: Use a `Context` type mapping to a `map[string]interface{}` for all event contexts (#444)
- *[breaking]* ref: Replace deprecated `ioutil` pkg with `os` & `io` (#454)
- ref: Optimize `stacktrace.go` from size and speed (#467)
- ci: Test against `go1.19` and `go1.18`, drop `go1.16` and `go1.15` support (#432, #477)
- deps: Dependency update to fix CVEs (#462, #464, #477)

_NOTE:_ This version drops support for Go 1.16 and Go 1.15. The currently supported Go versions are the last 3 stable releases: 1.19, 1.18 and 1.17.

## v0.13.0

- ref: Change DSN ProjectID to be a string (#420)
- fix: When extracting PCs from stack frames, try the `PC` field (#393)
- build: Bump gin-gonic/gin from v1.4.0 to v1.7.7 (#412)
- build: Bump Go version in go.mod (#410)
- ci: Bump golangci-lint version in GH workflow (#419)
- ci: Update GraphQL config with appropriate permissions (#417)
- ci: ci: Add craft release automation (#422)

## v0.12.0

- feat: Automatic Release detection (#363, #369, #386, #400)
- fix: Do not change Hub.lastEventID for transactions (#379)
- fix: Do not clear LastEventID when events are dropped (#382)
- Updates to documentation (#366, #385)

_NOTE:_
This version drops support for Go 1.14, however no changes have been made that would make the SDK not work with Go 1.14. The currently supported Go versions are the last 3 stable releases: 1.15, 1.16 and 1.17.
There are two behavior changes related to `LastEventID`, both of which were intended to align the behavior of the Sentry Go SDK with other Sentry SDKs.
The new [automatic release detection feature](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/issues/335) makes it easier to use Sentry and separate events per release without requiring extra work from users. We intend to improve this functionality in a future release by utilizing information that will be available in runtime starting with Go 1.18. The tracking issue is [#401](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/issues/401).

## v0.11.0

- feat(transports): Category-based Rate Limiting ([#354](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/354))
- feat(transports): Report User-Agent identifying SDK ([#357](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/357))
- fix(scope): Include event processors in clone ([#349](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/349))
- Improvements to `go doc` documentation ([#344](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/344), [#350](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/350), [#351](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/351))
- Miscellaneous changes to our testing infrastructure with GitHub Actions
  ([57123a40](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/commit/57123a409be55f61b1d5a6da93c176c55a399ad0), [#128](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/128), [#338](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/338), [#345](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/345), [#346](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/346), [#352](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/352), [#353](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/353), [#355](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/355))

_NOTE:_
This version drops support for Go 1.13. The currently supported Go versions are the last 3 stable releases: 1.14, 1.15 and 1.16.
Users of the tracing functionality (`StartSpan`, etc) should upgrade to this version to benefit from separate rate limits for errors and transactions.
There are no breaking changes and upgrading should be a smooth experience for all users.

## v0.10.0

- feat: Debug connection reuse (#323)
- fix: Send root span data as `Event.Extra` (#329)
- fix: Do not double sample transactions (#328)
- fix: Do not override trace context of transactions (#327)
- fix: Drain and close API response bodies (#322)
- ci: Run tests against Go tip (#319)
- ci: Move away from Travis in favor of GitHub Actions (#314) (#321)

## v0.9.0

- feat: Initial tracing and performance monitoring support (#285)
- doc: Revamp sentryhttp documentation (#304)
- fix: Hub.PopScope never empties the scope stack (#300)
- ref: Report Event.Timestamp in local time (#299)
- ref: Report Breadcrumb.Timestamp in local time (#299)

_NOTE:_
This version introduces support for [Sentry's Performance Monitoring](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/go/performance/).
The new tracing capabilities are beta, and we plan to expand them on future versions. Feedback is welcome, please open new issues on GitHub.
The `sentryhttp` package got better API docs, an [updated usage example](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/tree/master/_examples/http) and support for creating automatic transactions as part of Performance Monitoring.

## v0.8.0

- build: Bump required version of Iris (#296)
- fix: avoid unnecessary allocation in Client.processEvent (#293)
- doc: Remove deprecation of sentryhttp.HandleFunc (#284)
- ref: Update sentryhttp example (#283)
- doc: Improve documentation of sentryhttp package (#282)
- doc: Clarify SampleRate documentation (#279)
- fix: Remove RawStacktrace (#278)
- docs: Add example of custom HTTP transport
- ci: Test against go1.15, drop go1.12 support (#271)

_NOTE:_
This version comes with a few updates. Some examples and documentation have been
improved. We've bumped the supported version of the Iris framework to avoid
LGPL-licensed modules in the module dependency graph.
The `Exception.RawStacktrace` and `Thread.RawStacktrace` fields have been
removed to conform to Sentry's ingestion protocol, only `Exception.Stacktrace`
and `Thread.Stacktrace` should appear in user code.

## v0.7.0

- feat: Include original error when event cannot be encoded as JSON (#258)
- feat: Use Hub from request context when available (#217, #259)
- feat: Extract stack frames from golang.org/x/xerrors (#262)
- feat: Make Environment Integration preserve existing context data (#261)
- feat: Recover and RecoverWithContext with arbitrary types (#268)
- feat: Report bad usage of CaptureMessage and CaptureEvent (#269)
- feat: Send debug logging to stderr by default (#266)
- feat: Several improvements to documentation (#223, #245, #250, #265)
- feat: Example of Recover followed by panic (#241, #247)
- feat: Add Transactions and Spans (to support OpenTelemetry Sentry Exporter) (#235, #243, #254)
- fix: Set either Frame.Filename or Frame.AbsPath (#233)
- fix: Clone requestBody to new Scope (#244)
- fix: Synchronize access and mutation of Hub.lastEventID (#264)
- fix: Avoid repeated syscalls in prepareEvent (#256)
- fix: Do not allocate new RNG for every event (#256)
- fix: Remove stale replace directive in go.mod (#255)
- fix(http): Deprecate HandleFunc, remove duplication (#260)

_NOTE:_
This version comes packed with several fixes and improvements and no breaking
changes.
Notably, there is a change in how the SDK reports file names in stack traces
that should resolve any ambiguity when looking at stack traces and using the
Suspect Commits feature.
We recommend all users to upgrade.

## v0.6.1

- fix: Use NewEvent to init Event struct (#220)

_NOTE:_
A change introduced in v0.6.0 with the intent of avoiding allocations made a
pattern used in official examples break in certain circumstances (attempting
to write to a nil map).
This release reverts the change such that maps in the Event struct are always
allocated.

## v0.6.0

- feat: Read module dependencies from runtime/debug (#199)
- feat: Support chained errors using Unwrap (#206)
- feat: Report chain of errors when available (#185)
- **[breaking]** fix: Accept http.RoundTripper to customize transport (#205)
  Before the SDK accepted a concrete value of type `*http.Transport` in
  `ClientOptions`, now it accepts any value implementing the `http.RoundTripper`
  interface. Note that `*http.Transport` implements `http.RoundTripper`, so most
  code bases will continue to work unchanged.
  Users of custom transport gain the ability to pass in other implementations of
  `http.RoundTripper` and may be able to simplify their code bases.
- fix: Do not panic when scope event processor drops event (#192)
- **[breaking]** fix: Use time.Time for timestamps (#191)
  Users of sentry-go typically do not need to manipulate timestamps manually.
  For those who do, the field type changed from `int64` to `time.Time`, which
  should be more convenient to use. The recommended way to get the current time
  is `time.Now().UTC()`.
- fix: Report usage error including stack trace (#189)
- feat: Add Exception.ThreadID field (#183)
- ci: Test against Go 1.14, drop 1.11 (#170)
- feat: Limit reading bytes from request bodies (#168)
- **[breaking]** fix: Rename fasthttp integration package sentryhttp => sentryfasthttp
  The current recommendation is to use a named import, in which case existing
  code should not require any change:
  ```go
  package main

  import (
  	"fmt"

  	"github.com/getsentry/sentry-go"
  	sentryfasthttp "github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/fasthttp"
  	"github.com/valyala/fasthttp"
  )
  ```

_NOTE:_
This version includes some new features and a few breaking changes, none of
which should pose troubles with upgrading. Most code bases should be able to
upgrade without any changes.

## v0.5.1

- fix: Ignore err.Cause() when it is nil (#160)

## v0.5.0

- fix: Synchronize access to HTTPTransport.disabledUntil (#158)
- docs: Update Flush documentation (#153)
- fix: HTTPTransport.Flush panic and data race (#140)

_NOTE:_
This version changes the implementation of the default transport, modifying the
behavior of `sentry.Flush`. The previous behavior was to wait until there were
no buffered events; new concurrent events kept `Flush` from returning. The new
behavior is to wait until the last event prior to the call to `Flush` has been
sent or the timeout; new concurrent events have no effect. The new behavior is
inline with the [Unified API
Guidelines](https://docs.sentry.io/development/sdk-dev/unified-api/).

We have updated the documentation and examples to clarify that `Flush` is meant
to be called typically only once before program termination, to wait for
in-flight events to be sent to Sentry. Calling `Flush` after every event is not
recommended, as it introduces unnecessary latency to the surrounding function.
Please verify the usage of `sentry.Flush` in your code base.

## v0.4.0

- fix(stacktrace): Correctly report package names (#127)
- fix(stacktrace): Do not rely on AbsPath of files (#123)
- build: Require github.com/ugorji/go@v1.1.7 (#110)
- fix: Correctly store last event id (#99)
- fix: Include request body in event payload (#94)
- build: Reset go.mod version to 1.11 (#109)
- fix: Eliminate data race in modules integration (#105)
- feat: Add support for path prefixes in the DSN (#102)

- feat: Extract correct type and value from top-most error (#85)
- feat: Check for broken pipe errors in Gin integration (#82)
- fix: Client.CaptureMessage accept nil EventModifier (#72)

## v0.3.1

- feat: Send extra information exposed by the Go runtime (#76)
- fix: Handle new lines in module integration (#65)
- fix: Make sure that cache is locked when updating for contextifyFramesIntegration
- ref: Update Iris integration and example to version 12
- misc: Remove indirect dependencies in order to move them to separate go.mod files

## v0.3.0

- feat: Retry event marshaling without contextual data if the first pass fails
- fix: Include `url.Parse` error in `DsnParseError`
- fix: Make more `Scope` methods safe for concurrency
- fix: Synchronize concurrent access to `Hub.client`
- ref: Remove mutex from `Scope` exported API
- ref: Remove mutex from `Hub` exported API
- ref: Compile regexps for `filterFrames` only once
- ref: Change `SampleRate` type to `float64`
- doc: `Scope.Clear` not safe for concurrent use
- ci: Test sentry-go with `go1.13`, drop `go1.10`

_NOTE:_
This version removes some of the internal APIs that landed publicly (namely `Hub/Scope` mutex structs) and may require (but shouldn't) some changes to your code.
It's not done through major version update, as we are still in `0.x` stage.

## v0.2.1

_NOTE:_
In case of any performance issues due to source contexts IO, you can let us know and turn off the integration in the meantime with:

```go
sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
	Integrations: func(integrations []sentry.Integration) []sentry.Integration {
		var filteredIntegrations []sentry.Integration
		for _, integration := range integrations {
			if integration.Name() == "ContextifyFrames" {
				continue
			}
			filteredIntegrations = append(filteredIntegrations, integration)
		}
		return filteredIntegrations
	},
})
```
